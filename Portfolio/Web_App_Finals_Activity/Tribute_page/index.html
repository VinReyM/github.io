            <h2>As my Grandmother</h2>
            <p>
                She is my grandmother who lives in our province at Guinaoang, Mankayan, Benguet. We usually call her
                Lola taba or just lola, and she's fine with it. In a year, I always visit her twice or thrice since I
                currently live in Baguio City. And everytime I go home in our province, she always welcomes me with a
                warm hug. Oh how I miss those days when she gives me a big smile every time I visit her. It has not been
                long since she passed away and I always miss her every time I think about it. When I was a child, Lola
                would always let me take anything I want from her sari-sari store. She would always spoil me even if my
                parents are against it. During friday, we always go to the <em>sayote</em> farm to harvest some. She
                would teach me the proper way of harvesting vegetables and in return I help her carry all those
                <em>sayote</em> back home. It felt like it was just yesterday when we did it. She will always be the
                greatest Lola in my heart.
            </p>
            <h2>My message to her</h2>
            <p>
                Lola, I hope you are doing well where ever you are. You do not need to worry about me anymore, rest
                assured that I will always live my life to the fullest and finish my studies like you always say. It is
                unfortunate that you are not going to be there when I graduate. But I will always keep in mind
                everything you taught me and keep in my heart the love and care you gave me. I miss you Lola!
            </p>
